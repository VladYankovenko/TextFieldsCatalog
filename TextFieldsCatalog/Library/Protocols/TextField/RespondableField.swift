     Next responder, next field which will be activated with `next` button on keyboard or toolbar.

     You can setup any UIResponder object and it will be activated when user tap on `next` keyboard button.

     - Important:
        - When you setup non-nill object - your `returnKeyType` will set with `.next` value.
        - If you provide nill object - `returnKeyType` will set with `.default` value.
        - This rules doesn't apply into the TextView.
        - This property will be used separatly for your needs, but also it can be used with picker views from library (which have custom toolbar view with next/previous arrow buttons).
